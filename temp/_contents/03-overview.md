The twenty-first century has seen a series of breakthroughs in statistical machine learning and inference algorithms that allow us to solve many of the most challenging scientific and engineering problems in artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles, robotics and DNA sequence analysis. In the past few years, machine learning applications in search engines, wearable devices and social networks have broadly impacted our daily life. These algorithms adapt to the data at hand and are tolerant to noisy observations. The goal of this course is to provide principled mathematical tools to solve statistical inference problems you may encounter later. The first half of the course covers the fundamentals of statistical machine learning and supervised learning models. The second half of the course focuses on probabilistic inference and unsupervised learning. The examples of the course include object recognition; image search, document retrieval; sequence filtering and alignment; and data compression. This course reviews state-of-the-art algorithms and models for probabilistic inference and machine learning.
