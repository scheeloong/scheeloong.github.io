# Research Direction

I am curious about our intelligent ability to learn.

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, especially Machine Learning, as it helps me understand how learning works.

For instance, how do we model:
* Instantaneous Learning: How do we train a model to learn from correct examples? Ideas from Mathematical Optimization, Sampling, Variational Inference
* Delayed Learning: How do we learn by rewards and punishment? Ideas from Animal Learning, Reinforcement Learning
* Credit Assignment: After we finally succeed, how do we assign credit to which path along our success was more important for our success? 
* Inference: How do we calculate probability of events given evidences? Ideas from Probabilistic Graphical Models.
* Planning: How do we plan what to do given our available information? Ideas from Markov Decision Processes, Decision Trees.
* Information: ideas from Information Theory, Uncertainty, bayesian posterior beliefs distribution.
* Uncertainty: How do we know if a model is uncertain in its predictions?
* Signal Processing: How do we decide if an input or data is useful information or noise? Ideas from Signal Detection Theory.
* Memory: How do we remember information? ideas from Sequential Circuits in Digital Logics, to delayed processing. 
* Attention: The idea of focusing. Where to focus? When to focus? How long should we focus? Ideas from Information Retrieval
* Active Learning: Idea of actively deciding what to learn, since it's impossible to learn everything.
* Curriculum Learning: Idea creating a learning syllabus so that the model learns from easy to hard problems.
* Transfer Learning: How do we transfer the useful learnt information from one model to another? 
* Knowledge Distillation: How do we transfer the core information from a large model to a smaller model?
* Few Shot Learning: How do we learn from as few examples as possible? 
* Exploration vs Exhaustation: How do we decide if we should explore other decisions or dive into ones we already know?
* Semi-Supervised Learning: How do we learn about the population given a sample? 
* Imbalanced Learning: How do we learn about rare labels when our dataset is imbalanced? 
* Generative Learning: How do we learn to generate realistic data? 

Machine Learning research can be broken down into 4 steps: 
* Step 1: What is the problem? What is the type of data we are working with?
* Step 2: Modelling. What model should we use? What are the potential abilities of this model? 
* Step 3: How do we feasible train the model given our data?
* Step 4: Evaluation. How do we evaluate how well this model has learnt and execute its potential abilities ?

Machine Learning Models: (not mutually exclusive)
* Kernel Machines, Support Vector Machines: Being as far away from decision boundary as possible.
* Deep Learning, NN, CNN, RNN: Fire when you detect a useful signal.
* Reinforcement Learning: Learning from delayed feedback while planning.
* Probabilistic Graphical Models, BN, HMM, CRF: Ability to perform inference.
* Bayesian Nonparametrics, Gaussian Processes: Model complexity grows with data
* Mixture Models: Symptoms and Observations

I enjoy working with applied math and code.
