I research deep sequential imbalanced learning for recommender systems  under the supervision of [Professor Scott Sanner](http://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/).

Imbalanced:
Recommendation datasets are imbalanced. Popular items gets more attention, causing a positive feedback loop of 
recommending these popular items. How do we train and evaluate Deep models to learn both popular and unpopular items
well? 

Deep:
Using Deep Learning models to solve Recommender Systems.

Sequential:
Focusing on sequential recommendation problems. The recommendations are given in a form of a sequence. (e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Tinder)

Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff:
Deciding whether to recommend popular items (exploitation) or rare items for learning personalized user preference and gather data for rare items.

Active Learning: During the exploration phase, which items do I recommend? 

Offline Evaluation: 
Training Reinforcement Learning on games are feasible, you can simulate physics laws on a computer. How do you simulate user purchase behavior if we do not yet know how the human brain works? 

My general research interests are: 
Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, POMDP, MDP, Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Mathematical Optimization, Information Theory.
