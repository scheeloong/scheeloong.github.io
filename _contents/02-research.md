I research deep sequential imbalanced learning for recommender systems  under the supervision of [Professor Scott Sanner](http://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/).

Deep:
    Use Deep Learning models to solve Recommender Systems.

Sequential:
    Focusing on sequential recommendation problems.
    The recommendation interactions with a user occurs in the form of a sequence.
    e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Tinder

Imbalanced:
    Recommendation datasets are imbalanced.
    Popular items gets more attention, causing a positive feedback loop by traditional recommendation systems
    to recommend these items. How do we train and evaluate Deep models to learn both popular and unpopular items
    well? 

Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff:
    Deciding whether to recommend popular items (exploitation) or rare items (exploration).
    Recommending rare items allows us to learn more about a user's personal preference and 

Active Learning:
    During the exploration phase, which items do I recommend
    to learn about a user or an item with less samples? 

Offline Evaluation: 
    Training Reinforcement Learning on games are feasible, you can simulate physics laws on a computer.
    How do you simulate user purchase behavior if we do not yet know how the human brain works?
    The current alternative of online evaluations on real users is expensive.

My general research interests are: 
Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, POMDP, MDP, Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Mathematical Optimization, Information Theory.
