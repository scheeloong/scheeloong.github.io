### Overview

This is about Deep Learning

### Prerequisites

* Probability

* Real Analysis 

### Relationship with other courses

Since uncertainty is a central topic in machine learning, it's unsurprising that there are lots of courses at UofT focusing on it. Several departments offer core courses focused on probabilistic machine learning, with varying emphases:

* [CSC412, Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/courses/csc412/index.html)
* [STA414, Statistical Methods for Machine Learning](https://duvenaud.github.io/sta414/)
* [ECE521, Inference Algorithms and Machine Learning](https://ece521.github.io/)
