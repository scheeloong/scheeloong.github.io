# About

I am a first year MASc (Masters of Applied Science, research-based) student at the University of Toronto.

I am a member of the [Data Driven Decision Making Laboratory](http://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/).

I am curious about our intelligent ability to learn.

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning, as it helps me understand how learning works.

For instance, how do we model:
* Learning: How do we train a model to learn? Ideas from Optimization, Sampling, Variational Inference
* Inference: How do we do inference based on what we know? Ideas from Probabilistic Graphical Models 
* Planning: How do we plan what to do given our available information? Ideas from Markov Decision Processes.
* Rewards: How do we learn by rewards and punishment? Ideas from Animal Learning to Reinforcement Learning
* Information: ideas from Information Theory, Uncertainty, bayesian posterior beliefs distribution.
* Signal Processing: How do we decide if an input is useful information or noise? Ideas from Signal Detection Theory.
* Memory: How do we remember information? ideas from Sequential Circuits in Digital Logics, to delayed processing. 
* Attention: The idea of focusing. Where to focus? When to focus? How long should we focus? 
* Active Learning: The idea of deciding what to learn, since it's impossible to learn everything.

I enjoy working with applied math and code.

# Undergraduate 

During my undergraduate, I have done Software Engineering Internships at Google, Salesforce, Intel. 

Published a [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10601-016-9238-x) under the supervision of [Professor Christopher Beck](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/mie/faculty/beck).

Final year research group capstone project under the supervision of [Professor Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/).
